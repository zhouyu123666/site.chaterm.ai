Envelope Encryption achieves end-to-end data security through its innovative architecture that separates the encryption key from the master key, and is widely used by mainstream cloud services such as AWS and Google Cloud. It also demonstrates how Chaterm uses this technology to build a zero-trust security architecture, providing bank-level security protection for users&#39; sensitive data such as SSH keys and server configurations.</p><hr><h2 id="why-data-security-is-so-important" tabindex="-1">Why Data Security is So Important <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-data-security-is-so-important" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why Data Security is So Important&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In modern IT operations and development, SSH keys, server passwords, and database connection information are extremely sensitive digital assets. If this information is leaked, it can lead to: intrusion into core enterprise systems; theft or extortion of important data; business service disruptions; and damage to brand reputation. Traditional endpoint management tools typically use simple password encryption or store data in plaintext in the cloud, both of which have serious security vulnerabilities. Even with encryption, improper key management can still lead to breaches.</p><p><strong>Therefore, we need more secure and reliable data protection technologies to address these challenges.</strong></p><h2 id="what-is-envelope-encryption" tabindex="-1">What is Envelope Encryption? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-envelope-encryption" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is Envelope Encryption?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Envelope Encryption is an enterprise-grade encryption technology widely adopted by major cloud service providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba Cloud.

In terms of cutting-edge technology exploration, we are currently conducting preliminary research on <strong>homomorphic encryption technology</strong>, which will support direct computation operations in encrypted form in the future, further enhancing data privacy protection.
